    "A machine learning algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data. But what do we mean by learning? Mitchell (1997) provides a succinct deﬁnition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at tasks in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.” One can imagine a wide variety of experiences **E**, tasks **T**, and performance measures **P**. In the following sections, we provide intuitive descriptions and examples of the different kinds of tasks, performance measures, and experiences that can be used to construct machine learning algorithms.\n",

When $y=f(x)$, the model assigns an input described by vector $x$ to a category identiﬁed by numeric codey.

    "In the case of supervised learning, the example contains a label or target as well as a collection of features. For example, if we want to use a learning algorithm to perform object recognition from photographs, we need to specify which object appears in each of the photos. We might do this with a numeric code, with $0$ signifying a person, $1$ signifying a car, $2$ signifying a cat, and so forth. Often when working with a dataset containing a design matrix of feature observations $X$, we also provide a vector of labels $y$, with $y_i$ providing the label for example $i$."
