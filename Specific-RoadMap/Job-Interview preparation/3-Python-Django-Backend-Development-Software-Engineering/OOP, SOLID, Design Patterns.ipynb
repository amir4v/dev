    "## Creational:\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Abstract Factory: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One abstract/interface class with some children/subclasses which they implement the abstractions differently. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Builder: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in Python world. Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: There is some Interface and Abstraction part plus Implementation and \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B: There is a Class that the part A will play with it-and-its parameters and implementation and \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C: There is Maker/Builder class that takes a A type class object and acts as an API to do the work regardless of the kind of the A and returns your customized B Class. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Factory Method: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have a abstract/interface part with a compatiblized definition and implemention which there is a Factory class/part which base on it's parameters, it gives you an object of those abstract/interface part that is your desire. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Prototype: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The class can make a copy/clone of itself. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Singleton: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only one instance of a class is possible.\n",
    "## Structural\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Adapter: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Bridge: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Helps you through classes and their combination. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Bridge Design Pattern allows you to separate an object's abstraction (what it does) from its implementation (how it does it). This makes it easier to extend and change parts of your system independently. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Combines different classes through abstraction to prevent making classes which grows exponentially. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Composite: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imagine you have a toy box with different kinds of toys inside. Some toys are simple, like a ball, and others are more complex, like a toy car with wheels and doors. The Composite pattern lets you treat both simple and complex toys in the same way, like putting them in a toy box. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you combine and compose more complex objects with simple and complex classes and treat them the same (an object). \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Decorator: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decorator/Accessories \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Facade: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; API \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Flyweight: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prevent making repetitive objects and use somewhat storage and warehouse (but not exactly like this). \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Proxy: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proxy/Middleware/ManInTheMiddle \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.\n",
    "## Behaivioral\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Chain of Responsibility: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Iterator: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Iterator/__iter__ \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.). \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Memento: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Store some information or state or data or the object itself for the further usage. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "State: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets an object alter its behaivior when its internal state changes. (It's on you how you want to implement it like you can do it with an argument as a state or the paramater is the state like it's automatic.) (It appears as if the object changed its class.) \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Template Method: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Somehow Polymorphism. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets the subclasses implement some methods or change it or to some extent change the skeleton. (Basically put some implementation(s) for individuals.) \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Command: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like some different abstract implementation which they get an object and implement differentlly, which those different implementation can get that object to implement and a FrontendCommand gets those implementations as input to run/trigger their behaivior/action. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Mediator: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Switch hub. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Observer: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subscriber/Subscription mechanism; Notify system; Global tigger system. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Strategy: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imagine you have a toy car that can move in different ways: it can drive, fly, or even sail on water. Depending on the situation, you can change how the toy car moves. The Strategy pattern is like having different driving modes for your toy car, so you can switch modes to make it drive, fly, or sail whenever you want. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Visitor: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Visitors can have different behaiviors. (or behaiviors can change base on the visitor) (Or when i accept a (kind of) visitor then i want to just let them to do that kind of action that i want just for this kind of visitor.). \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. \\\n",
    "[ \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Interpreter: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imagine you have a secret language that only you and your friends understand. You have a special book that tells you how to translate words from the secret language into normal language. The Interpreter pattern is like that book: it helps you understand and translate the secret language into something you can read. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Null Object: \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Image you have some actions and methods in your class and someone wants an action that you haven't so you just return a valid NullObject/NullAction which means yes we do have a valid response for that request and that request does Null/Nothing, instead of error or raising exception. \\\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imagine you have a toy box with different toys, and sometimes the toy box is empty. When you want to play with a toy, you don't want to check if the toy is there every time. So, you create a pretend toy that doesn't do anything. This way, even if the toy box is empty, you always have something to play with, and you don't need to check if a toy is there. \\\n",
